## OpenCV
OpenCV was started at Intel in 1999 by Gary Bradsky and the first release came out in 2000. Vadim Pisarevsky
joined Gary Bradsky to manage Intelâ€™s Russian software OpenCV team. In 2005, OpenCV was used on Stanley, the
vehicle who won 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Later its active development continued under the support of Willow
Garage, with Gary Bradsky and Vadim Pisarevsky leading the project. Right now, OpenCV supports a lot of algorithms
related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning and it is expanding day-by-day.

Currently OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like C++, Python, Java etc and is available on
different platforms including Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, iOS etc. Also, interfaces based on CUDA and OpenCL
are also under active development for high-speed GPU operations.

OpenCV-Python is the Python API of OpenCV. It combines the best qualities of OpenCV C++ API and Python
language

## OpenCV-Python
Python is a general purpose programming language started by Guido van Rossum, which became very popular in
short time mainly because of its simplicity and code readability. It enables the programmer to express his ideas in
fewer lines of code without reducing any readability.

Compared to other languages like C/C++, Python is slower. But another important feature of Python is that it can
be easily extended with C/C++. This feature helps us to write computationally intensive codes in C/C++ and create
a Python wrapper for it so that we can use these wrappers as Python modules. This gives us two advantages: first,
our code is as fast as original C/C++ code (since it is the actual C++ code working in background) and second, it
is very easy to code in Python. This is how OpenCV-Python works, it is a Python wrapper around original C++
implementation.

And the support of Numpy makes the task more easier. Numpy is a highly optimized library for numerical operations.
It gives a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to-and-from Numpy arrays. So
whatever operations you can do in Numpy, you can combine it with OpenCV, which increases number of weapons in
your arsenal. Besides that, several other libraries like SciPy, Matplotlib which supports Numpy can be used with this.
So OpenCV-Python is an appropriate tool for fast prototyping of computer vision problems.
